## Key Projects

1. **[Particle in a Box Simulation](https://github.com/mzohaibh17-pixel/Quantum-Particle-in-a-Box)**  
   A Python simulation of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Features energy levels, wavefunctions, probability densities, and visualizations showing effects of box length and particle mass.

2. **[Quantum Wave Packets 1D & 2D](https://github.com/mzohaibh17-pixel/Quantum_Wave_Packets_1D_2D)**  
   Computational study of quantum wave packets in one and two dimensions. Visualizes 1D and 2D wavefunctions, probability densities, and time evolution animations. Includes stationary states, superposition effects, and interactive visualizations.

3. **[Exoplanet Habitability Analysis](https://github.com/mzohaibh17-pixel/Exoplanet_Habitability_Analysis)**  
   Analysis of the habitability of exoplanets, focusing on **Proxima Centauri b**. Fetches real-time data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, calculates stellar flux, equilibrium and surface temperatures, gravity, escape velocity, and checks habitable zones and tidal locking. Generates plots comparing with Earth and visualizes habitability zones.

4. **[SDSS Stellar Data Analysis](https://github.com/mzohaibh17-pixel/SDSS_Stellar_Data_Analysis)**  
   Conducted data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and feature engineering on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stellar dataset. Implemented **Linear, Ridge, and Polynomial Regression** to predict stellar redshift, evaluated models using RÂ² scores, and visualized insights with histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps, and predicted vs. actual redshift plots.
